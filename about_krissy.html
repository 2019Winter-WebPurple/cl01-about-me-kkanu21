        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <hr/> 
        <p>My name is Krista Kanu. Most people call me Krissy. I was born in Delaware, on February 12. I am a sophomore at Padua Academy, and I will be 16 years old in two weeks. I have one biological sister, 3 step siblings, and 3 half siblings.</p>
        <p>Here's a few random facts about me:</p> 
        <ul> <!--this is an unordered list of facts about me-->
            <li>My favorite colors are blue and black</li>
            <li>I love elephants</li>
            <li>I absolutely <b>love</b> watching movies; my favorites are:</li> 
            <ul> <!--this is an unordered list of my favorite movies-->
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1659337/"><i>The Perks of Being A Wallflower</i></a>
                <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5726616/"><i>Call Me By Your Name</i></a></li>
            </ul> 
        </ul>
        <p>My favorite quote happens to come from <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i>:</p> <blockquote>"Enjoy it. Because it's happening."</blockquote> 
        <p>I hate roller skating <b>AND</b> ice skating. I row for <a href="https://www.newportrowingclub.org/hswinterconditioning">Newport Rowing Club</a>, and I <b>LOVE</b> food and music very much. My favorite subject is literature, and I have no talents <b>at all</b>. My favorite thing to do is just being with my friends. My friends and family are my biggest priorities in life and I couldn't do it without them.</p>
        <p>I am very opinionated, and can also be <b>very</b> dramatic. I am very organized (for the most part), and I think that I am pretty funny. When I grow up, I want to become a lawyer and have two kids. Once I start my family, I am going to get a German Shepherd named Winston. I pretty much "planned out" my life already, and I intend to stick to it. I do not like to make decisions on the fly.</p>
        <p>Well that's all!</p>
